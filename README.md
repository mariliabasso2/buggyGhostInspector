Docs attached:
- PDF - Test Plan / Strategy / Report (if visualizing the file in Gitbub make sure you click on "view more pages" as the document has 10 pages)
- Json File - quick automation


As Iâ€™m not familiar with C# and have a tight deadline for this trial, I ended up choosing a Codeless tool for the automation approach.
